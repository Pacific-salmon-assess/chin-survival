Summary of CJS models


- Each model is based on Individual CJS models described in Section 12.3 of the Stan reference manual. 
- Each model includes time-varying estimates of survival (phi) and detection probability (p).
- Most models have a second, "_fixed_p" version, which allows a fixed detection probability to be passed to the last detection event. Used for systems where in-river detection probability is effectively perfect (e.g. Fraser, Columbia passed Bonneville)
- Frequently used model versions include posterior predictions in the generated quantities block, which are used to evaluate model fit, but check to ensure these code blocks are added in simpler models


Increasing order of complexity:
1. cjs_temp_fixeff -- no link function so no fixed effects; time-varying parameter for phi (alpha) and p (beta)
2. cjs_int_fixed_eff -- simple link function estimating interacting time/group phi and p parameters
3. cjs_add_fixed_eff -- simple link function estimating interacting time/group p parameters, but additive time/group phi parameters (i.e. n_occasions * n_groups vs. n_occasions + n_groups); generally appears to give better posterior predictions than interactions model
4. cjs_hier_eff_norm_nc -- link 5function includes average phi/p, time varying phi/p, and random intercept for group
5. cjs_add_hier_eff -- link function includes time varying phi/p and random intercept for group
