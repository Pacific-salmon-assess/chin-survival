  abstract = {Genetic stock identification (GSI) and parentage-based tagging (PBT) are being increasingly applied to salmon fisheries and hatchery broodstock management and assessment in Canada. GSI and PBT with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were applied in assessment of 2020 Chinook salmon fisheries and hatchery broodstocks in British Columbia (BC), Canada, with 9234 individuals successfully genotyped in fishery samples and 2250 PBT identifications made (24.4\% individual identification rate). As PBT identifications provided age of the individual and sex was determined from a SNP in the SNP panel, it was possible to evaluate sex ratios by age observed in the fishery sampling. Fishery catch sex ratios at age two and three years were male-biased, whereas those at age four and five years were female-biased. The combined age and sex information derived from genetics-based fishery sampling illustrates the ancillary information that becomes available relative to coded-wire tag (CWT) sampling if biological sampling of the catch is not conducted. There were 20,342 individuals genotyped in 65 hatchery broodstocks from which 6080 PBT identifications were made. Population-specific contributions to mixed-stock fisheries and exploitation rates were estimated with CWTs and GSI-PBT technologies for 13 populations, and close agreement of estimated population-specific exploitation rates between CWT and genetic methods for the 13 populations was observed (r2(11)= 0.951, P {$<$} 0.001). We conclude that a genetic approach can improve upon the results available from the current CWT program for assessment and management of Chinook salmon fisheries and hatchery broodstocks in BC, as well as provide ancillary information to improve wild Chinook salmon assessment and conservation by providing fishery impacts by conservation unit for any fishery in Canada.},

  abstract = {An analysis of the results of a 10-year study of the population ecology of juvenile hatchery and wild coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch in the Strait of Georgia produced new information about the interannual and interseasonal fluctuations in abundance and marine survival. A decline in the percentage of hatchery coho salmon was related to declines in hatchery fish abundance and marine survival; wild coho salmon abundance was more stable. The declining marine survival of hatchery coho salmon appeared to be related to a fixed average date of release from hatcheries and a possibility of earlier prey production. The relatively stable abundance of wild coho salmon may relate to a natural trend toward earlier ocean entry dates. Oscillations in hatchery coho salmon percentage and abundance were related to oscillations in abundance of juvenile pink salmon O. gorbuscha. The impact of oscillating density affected marine survival of hatchery coho salmon more than that of wild coho salmon. Marine survival and abundance of hatchery and wild coho salmon in July were positively related to average fork length, indicating that growth within the first few months after ocean entry affected marine survival. However, absolute size was not important, as wild coho salmon were consistently smaller than hatchery coho salmon. Wild coho salmon responded to conditions in the marine ecosystem differently than hatchery coho salmon, as relationships among growth, survival, and abundance were apparent for wild coho salmon earlier in the year than for hatchery fish. The length increase between July and September was inversely related to marine survival, suggesting that fish that were larger in July grew less and survived better because they were storing more lipids than smaller coho salmon. The study indicated that a more experimental management strategy is needed for both hatchery and wild coho salmon.},

  abstract = {Restoration of salmon and steelhead stocks in the Columbia River Basin depends in large part on the adequacy of streamflows needed to transport juveniles safely downstream to the ocean through a series of dams and reservoirs. Compared with preimpoundment conditions, lower spring and summer river flows and decreased water velocities are believed to increase juvenile salmonid travel times to the ocean, and potentially to reduce survival. Because of continuing disagreement about the quantities of flow releases needed to increase smolt survival, we reviewed literature from within and outside of the Columbia River Basin relating to the influence of water velocity on the survival of juvenile salmon and steelhead. Most of the studies reviewed found a positive relationship between outmigration flows and survival, but there is substantial uncertainty about many of the estimates. Early survival estimates made in the basin did not quantify variance and contain biases, errors, or reflect interactions with factors other than water velocity. Other influential factors that were examined in the review included predation, water quality, and physiological state of the smolts at the time of migration. Despite the limitations of existing data, the general relationship of increasing survival with increasing flow in the Columbia River Basin still appears to be reasonable.},

Movement patterns varied: several fish showed a postrelease "escape" response and a protracted "recovery" period, with evidence of diel patterns of vertical and horizontal movements becoming apparent after 8 h. After release, 12 of the 32 chinook salmon that were tracked tended to dive deep. Chinook salmon that dived deep ({$>$}200 m) were significantly larger than fish that remained nearer the surface (mean fork length, 87.2 vs. 77.3 cm, respectively), and deep diving was not correlated with aspects of handling that might have stressed the fish. The mean depth of travel calculated over all tracks was 70 m and the maximum depths were between 300 and 400 m. Average depths of travel were shallower during the day (25-64 m) than at night (49-78 m). Overall, mean ascent and descent rates were similar (11-12 m/5 min). Gross travel rates (ground speed), defined as the distance moved during 5-min intervals, averaged 1.9 km/h, but tidal currents could have influenced these estimates. Net travel rates, defined as the distance between the point of release and track termination, were slower than gross rates, averaging 0.60 km/h. Average grounds speeds were more rapid during the day (1.9-3.2 km/h) than at night (1.7-2.5 km/h). Compared with sockeye salmon tracked in the same area during 1985-1986, chinook salmon moved more slowly, in both gross and net travel rates, and swam deeper.}

We used a spatio-temporal bioenergetics model of the Northeast Pacific Ocean to quantify how predation by three species of pinnipeds and killer whales (Orcinus orca) on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has changed since the 1970s along the west coast of North America, and compare these estimates to salmon fisheries. We find that from 1975 to 2015, biomass of Chinook salmon consumed by pinnipeds and killer whales increased from 6,100 to 15,200 metric tons (from 5 to 31.5 million individual salmon). Though there is variation across the regions in our model, overall, killer whales consume the largest biomass of Chinook salmon, but harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) consume the largest number of individuals. The decrease in adult Chinook salmon harvest from 1975--2015 was 16,400 to 9,600 metric tons. Thus, Chinook salmon removals (harvest\,+\,consumption) increased in the past 40 years despite catch reductions by fisheries, due to consumption by recovering pinnipeds and endangered killer whales. Long-term management strategies for Chinook salmon will need to consider potential conflicts between rebounding predators or endangered predators and prey.}

Species-specific release measures are implemented as a conservation measure, but there remains little understanding of the resulting mortality. A purse seine fishery for Pacific salmon in British Columbia, Canada, was simulated with the goal of estimating post-release mortality for coho salmon, a species commonly released from commercial fisheries. Landed coho salmon (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 220) were tagged with acoustic transmitters and tracked along their coastal approach and into freshwater. Survival analyses accounting for variable migration pathways among populations revealed population-specific survival, with the population of greatest conservation concern having the best survival. Condition assessments revealed scale loss to be the strongest predictor of success. Physically exhausted fish, identified via reflex impairment tests, also experienced higher mortality. Results highlight the complexity of estimating release mortality in mixed-population commercial fisheries and are discussed in the context of management implications.},

To address this, we tagged 43 Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (57--100~cm) with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) in the eastern (October-- December) and central Bering Sea (August) to provide insights into the oceanic movements, behavior, and thermal environment of this species. The tags retrieved data for up to 260~days and end locations of tagged Chinook salmon spanned from the central Bering Sea (n\,=\,6), eastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (n\,=\,20), and the Gulf of Alaska (n\,=\,6). While at liberty, Chinook salmon occupied depths ranging from 0 to 538~m and experienced a thermal environment ranging from -0.6 to 13.5~{$^\circ$}C. Overall, mean depths of individual fish ranged from 4.5 to 127.9~m, while median depths ranged from 1.3 to 99.5~m. Although sample sizes were not even among months of the year, Chinook salmon occupied the shallowest and warmest water in May--September and the deepest and coolest water in December--March. Diel depth-specific diving behaviors of Chinook salmon were found in some tag records, but these behaviors appeared to be variable among individuals and plastic in nature within individuals. Results from this study provide insights into movement, diving behavior and the thermal environment of individual Chinook salmon which may have future application in understanding its ecology and developing strategies to further reduce incidental catch of this species.},

  abstract = {Resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) found in coastal waters of the cold-temperate northeastern Pacific are fish-feeding predators that specialize on Pacific salmon. Field studies have shown that although most available salmonids are consumed, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) is the whales' primary prey species, most likely because of its large size, high lipid content, and year-round occurrence in coastal waters. Chinook salmon availability appears to be important to the survival and recovery of resident killer whale populations. In this report we describe the results of recent field studies and analyses aimed at improving our understanding of the role played by Chinook salmon in the seasonal foraging ecology and energetics of resident killer whales. An additional 410 prey items identified from scale and tissue samples collected at the sites of resident feeding events provide further support for the importance of Chinook salmon in most seasons and coastal areas. Genetic stock identification of prey samples indicate that killer whales feed on Chinook salmon originating from a variety of regions between Southeast Alaska and Oregon, with stocks in the Fraser River system being of particular importance both coast-wide and in Critical Habitats. An updated analysis confirms the long-term correlation between survival of resident killer whales and range-wide Chinook abundance, though recent declines in Chinook abundance have not yet been associated with increased mortality rates. Estimates of Chinook salmon consumption based on daily prey energy requirements and diet composition suggest that resident killer whale populations at their current abundance may require over 1,000,000 Chinook per year, roughly equivalent to recent annual levels of harvests of this species in commercial and recreational marine fisheries. Estimates of Chinook salmon requirements for northern and southern resident killer whale populations in their Critical Habitats are also provided, as is an estimate of the Chinook abundance that would be required to support killer whale recovery over the next decade. Although the information in this report may be useful for future conservation and management of resident killer whales and their primary prey, further studies are needed to resolve existing uncertainties about year-round diet composition and feeding rates.},

  abstract = {Population-specific spatial and temporal distribution data are necessary to identify mechanisms regulating abundance and to manage anthropogenic impacts. However the distributions of highly migratory species are often difficult to resolve, particularly when multiple populations' movements overlap. Here we present an integrated model to estimate spatially-stratified, seasonal trends in abundance and population composition, using data from extensive genetic sampling of commercial and recreational Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fisheries in southern British Columbia. We use the model to estimate seasonal changes in population-specific standardized catch per unit effort (a proxy for abundance) across six marine regions, while accounting for annual variability in sampling effort and uncertain genetic stock assignment. We also share this model as an R package stockseasonr for application to other regions and species. Even at the relatively small spatial scales considered here, we found that patterns in seasonal abundance differed among regions and stocks. While certain locations were clearly migratory corridors, regions within the Salish Sea exhibited diverse, and often weak, seasonal patterns in abundance, emphasizing that they are important, year-round foraging habitats. Furthermore, we found evidence that stocks with similar freshwater life histories and adult run timing, as well as relatively proximate spawning locations, exhibited divergent distributions. Our findings highlight subtle, but important differences in how adult Chinook salmon use marine habitats. Down-scaled model outputs could be used to inform ecosystem-based management efforts by resolving the degree to which salmon overlap with other species of concern, as well as specific fisheries. More broadly, variation in stock-specific abundance among regions indicates efforts to identify mechanisms driving changes in size-at-maturity and natural mortality should account for distinct marine distributions.},

  abstract = {Animal migrations are costly and are often characterized by high predation risk for individuals. Three of the most oft-assumed mechanisms for reducing risk for migrants are swamping predators with high densities, specific timing of migrations and increased body size. Assessing the relative importance of these mechanisms in reducing predation risk particularly for migrants is generally lacking due to the difficulties in tracking the fate of individuals and population-level characteristics simultaneously. We used acoustic telemetry to track migration behaviour and survival of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolts released over a wide range of conspecific outmigration densities in a river associated with poor survival. The landscape was indeed high risk; smolt survival was poor ( 68\%) over 13.5 km of river examined even though migration was rapid (generally {$<$}48 h). Our results demonstrate that smolts largely employ swamping of predators to reduce predation risk. Increased densities of co-migrant conspecifics dramatically improved survival of smolts. The strong propensity for nocturnal migration resulted in smolts pausing downstream movements until the next nightfall, greatly increasing relative migration durations for smolts that could not traverse the study area in a single night. Smolt size did not appear to impact predation risk, potentially due to unique characteristics of the system or our inability to tag the entire size range of outmigrants. Movement behaviours were important in traversing this high-risk landscape and provide rare evidence for swamping to effectively reduce individual predation risk.},

  abstract = {The understanding of the dynamics of animal populations and of related ecological and evolutionary issues frequently depends on a direct analysis of life history parameters. For instance, examination of trade---offs between reproduction and survival usually rely on individually marked animals, for which the exact time of death is most often unknown, because marked individuals cannot be followed closely through time. Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments must be based on capture---recapture (or resighting) models which consider, besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture---recapture models oriented to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced as nuisance parameters. This emphasis on survival rates in capture---recapture models developed rapidly in the 1980s and used as a basic structure the Cormack---Jolly---Seber survival model applied to an homogeneous group of animals, with various kinds of constraints on the model parameters. These approaches are conditional on first captures; hence they do not attempt to model the initial capture of unmarked animals as functions of population abundance in addition to survival and capture probabilities. This paper synthesizes, using a common framework, these recent developments together with new ones, with an emphasis on flexibility in modeling, model selection, and the analysis of multiple data sets. The effects on survival and capture rates of time, age, and categorical variables characterizing the individuals (e.g., sex) can be considered, as well as interactions between such effects. This "analysis of variance" philosophy emphasizes the structure of the survival and capture process rather than the technical characteristics of any particular model. The flexible array of models encompassed in this synthesis uses a common notation. As a result of the great level of flexibility and relevance achieved, the focus is changed from fitting a particular model to model building and model selection. The following procedure is recommended: (1) start from a global model compatible with the biology of the species studied and with the design of the study, and assess its fit; (2) select a more parsimonious model using Akaike's Information Criterion to limit the number of formal tests; (3) test for the most important biological questions by comparing this model with neighboring ones using likelihood ratio tests; and (4) obtain maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters with estimates of precision. Computer software is critical, as few of the models now available have parameter estimators that are in closed form. A comprehensive table of existing computer software is provided. We used RELEASE for data summary and goodness---of---fit tests and SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of likelihood ratio tests. Five increasingly complex examples are given to illustrate the theory. The first, using two data sets on the European Dipper (Cinclus cinclus), tests for sex---specific parameters, explores a model with time---dependent survival rates, and finally uses a priori information to model survival allowing for an environmental variable. The second uses data on two colonies of the Swift (Apus apus), and shows how interaction terms can be modeled and assessed and how survival and recapture rates sometimes partly counterbalance each other. The third shows complex variation in survival rates across sexes and age classes in the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), with a test of density dependence in annual survival rates. The fourth is an example of experimental density manipulation using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). The last example attempts to examine a large and complex data set on the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), where parameters are age specific, survival is a function of an environmental variable, and an age {\texttimes} year interaction term is important. Heterogeneity seems present in this example and cannot be adequately modeled with existing theory. The discussion presents a summary of the paradigm we recommend and details issues in model selection and design, and foreseeable future developments.},

  abstract = {Considerable time and money are expended in the pursuit of catching fish with hooks (e.g., handlining, angling, longlining, trolling, drumlining) across the recreational, commercial and subsistence fishing sectors. The fish and other aquatic organisms (e.g., squid) that are captured are not a random sample of the population because external (e.g., turbidity) and underlying internal variables (e.g., morphology) contribute to variation in vulnerability to hooks. Vulnerability is the probability of capture for any given fish in a given location at a given time and mechanistically explains the population-\- level catchability coefficient, which is a fundamental and usually time-\-varying (i.e., dynamic) variable in fisheries science and stock assessment. The mechanistic drivers of individual vulnerability to capture are thus of interest to fishers by affecting catch rates, but are also of considerable importance to fisheries managers whenever hook-\- and-\-line-\-generated data contribute to stock assessments. In this paper, individual vulnerability to hooks is conceptualized as a dynamic state, in which individual fish switch between vulnerable and invulnerable states as a function of three interdependent key processes: an individual fish's internal state, its encounter with the gear, and the characteristics of the encountered gear. We develop a new conceptual framework of ``vulnerability,'' summarize the major drivers of fish vulnerability, and conclude that fish vulnerability involves complex processes. To understand vulnerability, a shift to interdisciplinary research and the integration of ecophysiology, fish ecology, fisheries ecology and human movement ecology, facilitated by new technological developments, is required.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Movement data represent important inputs to both numerical and conceptual models that contribute to the assessment and management of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the eastern North Pacific. While conventional mark-recovery data have greatly increased our understanding of these populations, tagging methods that produce only endpoint data (i.e., locations at tagging and recapture) cannot address dynamics such as the timing, frequency, and recurrence of movements. As a preliminary step in evaluating the feasibility of using acoustic biotelemetry for addressing management-relevant questions for relatively deepwater ({$\leq$} 600 m depth) species, we conducted tests of the detection range between VEMCO V16-5H transmitters and VR2W receivers. Six range-test stations were established that varied from a relatively shallow (154 m), narrow (3.8 km) ocean pass; through the mouth of a wide (20 km), deep (600 + m) fjord; and over the continental shelf. Each station consisted of one receiver mooring and five transmitter moorings deployed at regular distances from 200 to 1200 m from the base of the receiver mooring. Bottom depth varied from 195 to 588 m. Transmitters were suspended 0.5 and 5 m off bottom, and receivers at 145--400 m below the sea surface depend on bottom depth. Receivers were deployed for 162--595 days; however, maximum transmission time was 365 days. Results:{\enspace} The rate at which acoustic transmissions were detected by the receivers decreased with distance from the transmitters, mostly monotonically; at first gradually, from transmitters at distances of 400--800 m from the receivers, and then more steeply at distances beyond 800 m. Considerable variability in detection rates was observed, including low detection rates from individual locations and distances. Temporal changes in detection rates were observed that included convergence/divergence between detection of transmitters at a given distance from receivers but that were suspended at different elevations above bottom; stepwise seasonal shifts in mean detection; diurnal periodicity that was likely due to diurnal winds; and tidally mediated detection cycles. We determined that a linear ``gate'' of receivers spaced 1000 m apart would have a very high probability ({$\geq$} 0.99) under most conditions of detecting an acoustically tagged Pacific halibut transiting the gate, and that tagged-halibut identification rates using 2400-m receiver spacing could approach or exceed 90\%. However, during episodic periods of relatively poor tag detection, these rates are likely to decline to {\textasciitilde} 60--80\%; and to below 10\% under extreme conditions. Conclusions:{\enspace} Acoustic telemetry is a feasible technique for monitoring the movement of deepwater epibenthic fishes. However, temporal and spatial variability in detection rates, especially in seasonally stratified waters, has a strong potential to impart biases on study results and generate spurious patterns unrelated to tagged-fish behavior. The nature of such biases should be carefully considered during array placement and data interpretation. Range testing should be conducted at all geographic locations at which arrays are to be established, rather than extrapolating},

  abstract = {Although many coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) caught in recreational fisheries are harvested, a substantial number of salmon are released after capture. Mortality rates of coho salmon released from recreational fisheries are largely unknown in the marine environment. This two-year study investigated factors associated with postrelease mortality and travel rate of coho salmon in a marine recreational fishery in British Columbia, Canada. Adult coho salmon were recreationally angled in the marine environment, affixed with acoustic tags, and tracked during their return migration to natal spawning streams using a network of acoustic receivers. We found postrelease mortality to the first point of detection ({\textasciitilde}50 km from release) was 31.5\% (95\% CI: 26.1 -- 37.4\%; n = 279). Scale loss, eye damage, bleeding, and smaller body size of coho salmon were associated with increased odds of mortality. Scale loss and smaller body size were also associated with slower migration rate post-release. Air exposure up to five minutes was not found to be a driving factor in mortality or travel rate. These fishingrelated injuries can cause immediate physiological and behavioural disturbances, increase vulnerability to predation, infection, and disease, and delay migration as the fish recovers. Smaller coho salmon may also be less capable of overcoming capture stress. Our study highlights the importance of quantifying mortality of wild fish in their natural environment, and we suggest that small changes to fishing practices (e.g., smaller hook sizes, less handling, etc.) could make large differences in release survival thus encouraging a more sustainable recreational fishery.},

The causal agents underpinning these shifts are largely unknown. Here we investigate the potential role of late-stage marine mortality, defined as occurring after the first winter at sea, in driving this species' changing age structure. Simulations using a stage-based life cycle model that included additional mortality during after the first winter at sea better reflected observed changes in the age structure of a well-studied and representative population of Chinook salmon from the Yukon River drainage, compared with a model estimating environmentally-driven variation in age-specific survival alone. Although the specific agents of late-stage mortality are not known, our finding is consistent with work reporting predation by salmon sharks (               Lamna ditropis               ) and marine mammals including killer whales (               Orcinus orca               ). Taken as a whole, this work suggests that Pacific salmon mortality after the first winter at sea is likely to be higher than previously thought and highlights the need to investigate selective sources of mortality, such as predation, as major contributors to rapidly changing age structure of spawning adult Chinook salmon.},

  abstract = {Research on fisheries bycatch and discards frequently involves the assessment of reflex impairment, injury, or blood physiology as means of quantifying vitality and predicting post-release mortality, but exceptionally few studies have used all three metrics concurrently. We conducted an experimental purse seine fishery for Pacific salmon in the Juan de Fuca Strait, with a focus on understanding the relationships between different sublethal indicators and whether mortality could be predicted in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) bycatch. We monitored mortality using a ;24-h net pen experiment (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 118) and acoustic telemetry (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 50), two approaches commonly used to assess bycatch mortality that have rarely been directly compared. Short-term mortality was 21\% in the net pen experiment (;24 h) and estimated at 20\% for telemetry-tagged fish (;48--96 h). Mortality was predicted by injury and reflex impairment, but only in the net pen experiment. Higher reflex impairment was mirrored by perturbations to plasma ions and lactate, supporting the notion that reflex impairment can be used as a proxy for departure from physiological homeostasis. Reflex impairment also significantly correlated with injury scores, while injury scores were significantly correlated with plasma ion concentrations. The higher time-specific mortality rate in the net pen and the fact that reflexes and injury corresponded with mortality in that experiment, but not in the telemetry-tagged fish released into the wild could be explained partly by confinement stress. While holding experiments offer the potential to provide insights into the underlying causes of mortality, chronic confinement stress can complicate the interpretation of patterns and ultimately affect mortality rates. Collectively, these results help refine our understanding of the different sublethal metrics used to assess bycatch and the mechanisms that can lead to mortality.},

  abstract = {The assumption that animals released from fishing gears survive has frequently been scrutinized by researchers in recent years. Mortality estimates from these research efforts can be incorporated into management models to ensure the sustainability of fisheries and the conservation of threatened species. Post-release mortality estimates are typically made by holding the catch in a tank, pen or cage for short-term monitoring (e.g. 48 h). These estimates may be inaccurate in some cases because they fail to integrate the challenges of the wild environment. Most obvious among these challenges is predator evasion. Stress and injury from a capture experience can temporarily impair physiological capacity and alter behaviour in released animals, a period during which predation risk is likely elevated. In large-scale commercial fisheries, predators have adapted their behaviour to capitalize on impaired fishes being discarded, while in recreational catch-and-release fisheries, exercise and air exposure can similarly impede the capacity for released fish to evade opportunistic predators. Owing to the indirect and often cryptic nature of this source of mortality, very few studies have attempted to document it. A survey of the literature demonstrated that {$<$}2\% of the papers in the combined realms of bycatch and catch-and-release have directly addressed or considered post-release predation. Future research should combine field telemetry and laboratory studies using both natural and simulated predation encounters and incorporate physiological and behavioural endpoints. Quite simply, predation is an understudied and underappreciated contributor to the mortality of animals released from fishing gears.},

The response of Steller and California sea lions to the large run of pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) in 2011 was less than expected. Sea lions of these species rarely ate large (roughly {$\geq$}50 cm in total length) Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), indicating that they have limited direct competition for prey with the southern resident distinct population segment of killer whales (Orcinus orca). Combined, California and Steller sea lions in northwest Washington consumed a mass of coho salmon similar to that landed by commercial fisheries in \-Washington State. More work on modeling the effect of the predation by California and Steller sea lions on salmon populations, particularly for coho salmon, is needed to better evaluate the conservation and productivity of Pacific salmon.},

  abstract = {Ocean fisheries often target and catch aggregations comprised of multiple populations or groups of a given species. Chinook salmon originating from rivers throughout the west coast of North America support mixed-stock ocean fisheries and other ecosystem components, notably as prey for marine mammals. We construct the first coastwide state-space model for fall Chinook salmon tagged fish released from California to British Columbia between 1977 and 1990 to estimate of seasonal ocean distribution along the west coast of North America. We incorporate recoveries from multiple ocean fisheries and allow for regional variation in fisheries vulnerability and maturation. We show that Chinook salmon ocean distribution depends strongly on region of origin and varies seasonally while survival showed regionally varying temporal patterns. Simulations incorporating juvenile production data provide proportional stock composition in different ocean regions and the first coastwide projections of Chinook salmon aggregate abundance. Our model provides an extendable framework that can be applied to understand drivers of Chinook salmon biology (e.g. climate effects on ocean distribution) and management effects (e.g. consequences of juvenile production changes).}

To field test model assumptions, passive integrated transponder tagged chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) smolts were released on seven consecutive days in 1993 above Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River. These releases were used to estimate sampling variability of survival estimates for comparison with model-based variance estimates and to assess mixing of detected and nondetected individuals. Field results satisfied model assumptions. The average survival estimate from point of release to the tailrace of Lower Granite Dam (31 km) was 0.902 {\textpm} 0.004 (mean {\textpm} SE).

We estimated survival probabilities and travel time through the lower Snake River and detection probabilities at dams for each weekly release group. The average median time between release and arrival at Lower Granite Dam was 43.5 d. For each group, we split this time into two nearly equal (on average) periods: one when most fish in the group were rearing and one when most fish had apparently begun active seaward migration. The estimated survival for hatchery fish from release to the tailrace of Lower Granite Dam decreased with release date each year. The estimated survival through this reach was significantly correlated with three environmental variables: survival decreased as discharge (``flow'') decreased, as water transparency increased, and as water temperature increased. Because the environmental variables were highly correlated among themselves, we were unable to determine whether any factors were more important than the others. All three factors have plausible biological consequences for rearing and actively migrating fish, and survival is probably influenced by all of them and possibly by interactions among them as well. Summer flow augmentation will increase discharge and decrease water temperature (provided the additional water is not too warm) and probably increase the speed of seaward migration of smolts, all of which are beneficial to the recovery of threatened Snake River fall chinook salmon.},

  abstract = {The ocean feeding grounds of juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. range over several thousand kilometers in which ocean conditions, prey quality and abundance, and predator assemblages vary greatly. Therefore, the fate of individual stocks may depend on where they migrate and how much time they spend in different regions. Juvenile (n = 6,266) and immature (n = 659) Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were collected from coastal Washington to Southeast Alaska in coastal trawl surveys from February to November 1998--2008, which allowed us to reconstruct changes in stock composition for seasons and regions by means of DNA stock identification techniques. Individuals were allocated to 12 regional stocks. The genetic stock assignments were directly validated by showing that 96\% of the 339 known-origin, coded-wire-tagged fish were accurately allocated to their region of origin. Overall, the analyses performed in this study support the main findings of previous work based on tagging. However, given that the sample sizes for all stocks were larger and additional stocks were analyzed, we can extend those results; coastal residency of local stocks in their first year at sea with differences between smolt classes for southern stocks. Notably, yearling Chinook salmon moved quickly into waters north of the west coast of Vancouver Island, including Southeast Alaska. Furthermore, subyearling salmon were found over shallower bottom depths than yearling fish. Summer catches in all regions were dominated by Columbia River yearling fish, which suggests a rapid northward migration. In contrast, very few Columbia River subyearling fish were recovered north of Vancouver Island. Columbia River fish were a minor component of the catches in fall and winter, as fish originating from other southern stocks dominated catches off the west coast of Vancouver Island while northern British Columbia and Southeast Alaska stocks dominated northern regions during these time periods. In addition, we found no effect of hatchery origin on the distribution of fish.},

However, in several locations where pinnipeds have increased, they have been blamed for preventing the recovery of commercially valuable fish species through predation. Prompted by increasing pinniped abundance within the Columbia River (CR), USA, over a 6-year period, we used passive integrated transponder tags to measure the survival of adult spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) through the estuary and lower CR to Bonneville Dam (river kilometre 234). We estimated 51\,751 -- 224\,705 salmon died annually within this reach from sources other than harvest. Mixed-effects logistic regression modelling identified pinniped predation as the most likely source of this mortality. The odds of survival was estimated to decrease by 32\% (95\% CI: 6\%--51\%) for every additional 467 sea lions (Zalophus californianus and Eumetopias jubatus) present within the CR and to increase by 32\% (95\% CI: 8\%--61\%) for every increase of 1.5 in the log of American shad (Alosa sapidissima), a potential prey item for sea lions.},

I used this data set to examine the spatial and temporal variation in the marine distributions of 77 hatchery and 16 wild populations of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha based on recoveries of an estimated 632,000 tagged salmon in coastal waters from southern California to the Bering Sea during 1979--1994 (and 1995--2004 for select hatcheries). Chinook salmon showed 12 distinct region-specific recovery patterns. Chinook salmon originating in a common freshwater region had similar marine distributions, which were distinct from those of adjacent regions. Different run types (e.g., spring, summer, and fall runs) originating in the same region exhibited variation in their marine distributions consistent with recovery at different stages of their ocean residence period. Recovery patterns were surprisingly stable across years, despite high interannual variation in ocean conditions. By contrast, ocean age influenced recovery patterns, as older fish were recovered further from their natal stream than younger fish. Although most of the CWT data used in the analysis came from hatchery fish, recoveries of tagged wild populations indicate patterns similar to those of fish from nearby hatcheries. The consistency in these findings across broad geographic areas suggests that they apply to Chinook salmon across the entire Pacific Rim. Similar findings for tagged coho salmon O. kisutch indicate that the observed patterns may apply to Pacific salmon as a whole and provide a model for other highly migratory fishes that have not benefited from such intensive tagging programs. The results also have implications for the genetic control of migration and salmon's ability to respond to climate change.}
