- From 2019 to 2023 XX tags were deployed on mature Chinook salmon prior to freshwater migrations to spawning locations
	- Study area and stock comp fig
- Acoustic tags were detected on a network of stationary acoustic receivers
	- Specific locations varied from year to year; however coverage extended from southwest Vancouver Island to the mouth of the Columbia River and throughout the southern Salish Sea
	- Additionally fish returning to the Fraser or Columbia rivers were detected by freshwater acoustic or PIT receivers, allowing survival to be estimated through the initial stages of freshwater migrations
- We used acoustic telemetry detections data to address two related objectives
	- 1) Estimate stage-specific survival rates during the return migration to identify locations with relatively high mortality
	- 2) Quantify the relative effect of individual condition (body size and lipid content) on survival rates while accounting for direct and indirect effects of factors such as sampling date, exploitation rate and stock identity
